// ComputeVCGPayment determines the payment for the auction winner using
// VCG-style pricing adjusted for embedding-space distance.
//
// When a runner-up exists, payment = runner-up price × B^(distW²/σW² - distR²/σR²),
// where B = LogBase. This accounts for the embedding distance differential between
// winner and runner-up at the query location. The winner pays only enough to beat
// the runner-up in embedding-adjusted score space.
//
// The payment is the winner's critical value: the larger of the
// competitor-implied threshold and the reserve (bid floor). With no
// runner-up, the critical value is the reserve alone — zero if the
// publisher set none.
//
// Individual rationality: payment ≤ winner's bid price.
